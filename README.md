# Friday Night Funkin' Sprite to GIF Exporter

Hello!

This is a very simple tool I made to convert Friday Night Funkin' XML, JSON, and PNG files into animated GIFs.

It works with:
- **Psych Engine**
- **Kade Engine**
- **FPS Plus**

> 🛠️ You need to set the correct engine in the `SCRIPT_CONFIG.txt` file provided in the ZIP.

## ✨ Features

- Folder-based and manual mode
- Auto-centering toggle
- Frame dimension scaling toggle
- Clean output GIFs compatible with all major FNF modding tools

Enjoy!
