# Friday Night Funkin' Sprite to GIF Exporter

Hello!

This is a very simple tool I made to convert Friday Night Funkin' XML, JSON, and PNG files into animated GIFs.

It works with:
- **Psych Engine**
- **Kade Engine**
- **FPS Plus**

> 🛠️ **Important:** You need to set the correct engine in the `SCRIPT_CONFIG.txt` file provided in the ZIP.

- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

If you don’t have Pillow installed, run this in Command Prompt:

Or, if that doesn’t work:

`python -m pip install pillow`
